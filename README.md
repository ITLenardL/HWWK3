# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Tasked to create a password generator that can have conditions such as including/excluding certain character types such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special. It should then return the generated password in a innerhtml box.

## HWWK3

The aim is to create a password generator that starts up on a button click, that will prompt for length of password and then what characters to include. It should then generate a password given the criteria answered. Additional to this, a copy password button may be included for ease of use.

## Problems
Issues I ran into were how to have the code take from an array and create a new array, after much research I found some functions that were capable. I also had issues with getting my if and else statements correct to not effect each other and this has improved with the formatting of my code to see each piece as a section. I included a fair amount of css in the html elements for basic styling and because I started this way I didn't include as much within the css document just to keep the practice uniform.

## Structure:
Html, css and javascript file all in root directory
